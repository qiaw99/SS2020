## Cloud Type
- A private cloud is a cloud service that is not shared with any other organization. The private cloud user has the cloud to themselves.

- By contrast, a public cloud is a cloud service that shares computing services among different customers, even though each customer's data and applications running in the cloud remain hidden from other cloud customers.

## XaaS
IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS are the main models of providing cloud services. Gartner, the world's leading research and advisory company, identifies them as follows:

- IaaS — a client gets only infrastructure,
- PaaS — a client gets infrastructure and software for application development,
- SaaS — a client gets a ready-to-use application in the cloud.
