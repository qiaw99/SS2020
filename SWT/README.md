# Softwaretechnik(10 LP)
Software Engineering aims at providing answers to the following questions:
- How to find out which characteristics a software should have (requirements engineering)
- How to describe these characteristics (specification)
- How to structure software so that it can be built easily and changed flexibly (architecture and design)
- How to change software which does not (or no longer) have such a structure or that is difficult to understand (reengineering)
- How to uncover defects in software (quality assurance, testing)
- How to organize the tasks in a software company or department to regularly achieve cost-efficient and high-quality results (constructive quality assurance, process management, project management)
- Which common problems underlie all of these questions and which general approaches underlie the methods and techniques that are used
...and many similar ones.
